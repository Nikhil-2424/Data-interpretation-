#Data interpreatation
This project presents a detailed case study titled "Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis of an E-Commerce Platform." 
The primary objective of this study is to analyze customer buying patterns, product preferences, and regional sales performance using real-world-like transactional data. 
The dataset includes comprehensive fields such as Order ID, Product Name, Category, Quantity Sold, Unit Price, Total Sales, Sale Date, Sales Person, and Region.
Additional calculated fields like Average Sales, Total Sale Transactions, and Highest Sales are used to uncover meaningful insights that are essential for business intelligence.
The data has been organized in a structured and user-friendly tabular format, making it easy to interpret and analyze.
Key performance metrics such as total and average sales by category, top-selling products, most profitable regions, and individual sales performance have been extracted.
These insights support decision-making processes in marketing, inventory management, and strategic planning.
This README serves as a guide for understanding the purpose, structure, and analytical approach of the project.
All analysis is done using a clean 10-record dataset to maintain clarity while covering a broad range of business scenarios.
Missing values were intentionally included in some calculated fields to demonstrate how business analysts derive insights from raw transactional data.
